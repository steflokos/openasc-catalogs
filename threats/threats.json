In automotive systems, this can involve impersonating ECUs, users, or external services to inject false data, gain access to restricted functions, or bypass authentication. Spoofing can compromise confidentiality and authenticity, leading to unauthorized actions or data leaks. Effective countermeasures include strong authentication, cryptographic protections, and monitoring for abnormal communication patterns.",
