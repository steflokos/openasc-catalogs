In automotive systems, this can involve impersonating ECUs, users, or external services to inject false data, gain access to restricted functions, or bypass authentication. Spoofing can compromise confidentiality and authenticity, leading to unauthorized actions or data leaks. Effective countermeasures include strong authentication, cryptographic protections, and monitoring for abnormal communication patterns.",

Some vehicles are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store, and an adversary may seek to place a malicious application in an authorized app store, enabling the application to be installed onto targeted devices. App stores typically require developer registration and use vetting techniques to identify malicious applications, which adversaries may seek to circumvent by downloading new code at runtime or by using obfuscation techniques. Adversaries may also seek to evade vetting by placing code in a malicious application to detect whether it is running in an app analysis environment and, if so, avoid performing malicious actions while under analysis. Adversaries may also use fake identities, payment cards, etc., to create developer accounts to publish malicious applications to app stores. Adversaries may also use control of a target's Google account to use the Google Play Store's remote installation capability to install apps onto the Android devices associated with the Google account. Only applications that are available for download through the Google Play Store can be remotely installed using this technique. This ‘Malicious app' technique also includes installing a malicious application on targeted mobile devices without involving an authorized app store (e.g., Google Play Store or the OEM's app store). Adversaries may wish to avoid placing malicious applications in an authorized app store due to increased potential risk of detection or other reasons. However, mobile devices often are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store which would prevent this technique from working. Delivery methods for the malicious application include spearphishing attachments, spearphishing links, and third party app stores (as opposed to an authorized app store that the device implicitly trusts as part of its default behavior), which may not apply the same level of scrutiny to apps as applied by an authorized app store. Some Android malware comes with functionality to install additional applications, either automatically or when the adversary instructs it to. Finally, this technique also includes situations where an adversary develops and distributes malware that masquerades as as a legitimate application. This can be done in two different ways: by embedding the malware in a legitimate application, or by pretending to be a legitimate application. Embedding the malware in a legitimate application is done by downloading the application, disassembling it, adding the malicious code, and then re-assembling it.The app would appear to be the original app, but would contain additional malicious functionality. The adversary could then publish the malicious application to app stores or use another delivery method. Pretending to be a legitimate application relies heavily on lack of scrutinization by the user. Typically, a malicious app pretending to be a legitimate one will have many similar details as the legitimate one, such as name, icon, and description. Malicious applications may also masquerade as legitimate applications when requesting access to the accessibility service in order to appear as legitimate to the user, increasing the likelihood that the access will be granted. This technique is a combination of three techniques described in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix for mobile devices: Deliver Malicious App via Authorized App Store, Deliver Malicious App via Other Means, and Masquerade as Legitimate Application.",

Some ECUs possess physical debug interfaces that are not exposed outside their enclosures. With sufficient time, an adversary can partially disassemble the vehicle to obtain physical access to these ECUs, remove their enclosures, and connect or solder cables to access these debug interfaces. Direct physical access can also be used by an adversary to attempt different types of glitching attacks, side channel attacks, memory removal, reprogramming, and replacement, as well as others. To gain access to a vehicle an adversary could replace an ECU with one they have modified ahead of time (e.g., a modified service or junkyard part).",

Supply chain compromise can take place at any stage of the supply chain including:  - Manipulation of development tools, - Manipulation of a development environment, - Manipulation of source code repositories (public or private), - Manipulation of source code in open-source dependencies, - Manipulation of software update/distribution mechanisms, - Compromised/infected system images (multiple cases of removable media infected at the factory), - Replacement of legitimate software with modified versions, - Sales of modified/counterfeit products to legitimate distributors, - Shipment interdiction. While supply chain compromise can impact any component of hardware or software, attackers looking to gain execution have often focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in software distribution or update channels.  Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set  or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.  Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may also be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency. This technique was adapted from MITRE ATT&CK.",
