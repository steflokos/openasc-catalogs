Some vehicles are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store, and an adversary may seek to place a malicious application in an authorized app store, enabling the application to be installed onto targeted devices. App stores typically require developer registration and use vetting techniques to identify malicious applications, which adversaries may seek to circumvent by downloading new code at runtime or by using obfuscation techniques. Adversaries may also seek to evade vetting by placing code in a malicious application to detect whether it is running in an app analysis environment and, if so, avoid performing malicious actions while under analysis. Adversaries may also use fake identities, payment cards, etc., to create developer accounts to publish malicious applications to app stores. Adversaries may also use control of a target's Google account to use the Google Play Store's remote installation capability to install apps onto the Android devices associated with the Google account. Only applications that are available for download through the Google Play Store can be remotely installed using this technique. This ‘Malicious app' technique also includes installing a malicious application on targeted mobile devices without involving an authorized app store (e.g., Google Play Store or the OEM's app store). Adversaries may wish to avoid placing malicious applications in an authorized app store due to increased potential risk of detection or other reasons. However, mobile devices often are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store which would prevent this technique from working. Delivery methods for the malicious application include spearphishing attachments, spearphishing links, and third party app stores (as opposed to an authorized app store that the device implicitly trusts as part of its default behavior), which may not apply the same level of scrutiny to apps as applied by an authorized app store. Some Android malware comes with functionality to install additional applications, either automatically or when the adversary instructs it to. Finally, this technique also includes situations where an adversary develops and distributes malware that masquerades as as a legitimate application. This can be done in two different ways: by embedding the malware in a legitimate application, or by pretending to be a legitimate application. Embedding the malware in a legitimate application is done by downloading the application, disassembling it, adding the malicious code, and then re-assembling it.The app would appear to be the original app, but would contain additional malicious functionality. The adversary could then publish the malicious application to app stores or use another delivery method. Pretending to be a legitimate application relies heavily on lack of scrutinization by the user. Typically, a malicious app pretending to be a legitimate one will have many similar details as the legitimate one, such as name, icon, and description. Malicious applications may also masquerade as legitimate applications when requesting access to the accessibility service in order to appear as legitimate to the user, increasing the likelihood that the access will be granted. This technique is a combination of three techniques described in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix for mobile devices: Deliver Malicious App via Authorized App Store, Deliver Malicious App via Other Means, and Masquerade as Legitimate Application.",

While supply chain compromise can impact any component of hardware or software, attackers looking to gain execution have often focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in software distribution or update channels.  Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set  or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.

            "description": "Adversaries may compromise the cryptographic mechanisms used by vehicles to bypass controls that would otherwise protect assets. These assets may be internal to an ECU, or used in communication between ECUs within the vehicle, or with services outside the vehicle. This technique does not cover exploitation of poorly-protected keys. See  ECU Credential Dumping (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0007/ATM-T0039) & Unsecured Credentials (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0007/ATM-T0040). Cryptographic methods can be used to protect the security properties of assets both within a vehicle or ECU and between a vehicle and other communication partners. They are intended to be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated key. Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key. Adversaries can compromise assets within the vehicle (or its ECUs) by exploiting a variety of issues relating to cryptography. Examples and references are given below - these are in no way an exhaustive list. There are a huge number of cryptographic flaws of various kinds which have existed and continue to occur. - The algorithm is inherently weak (Dismantling Megamos Crypto: Wirelessly Lockpicking a Vehicle Immobilizer, Gone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2). Recommendation: use consensus standard cryptography. - The security strength of the cryptography used is not sufficient. Recent recommendations can be found in Recommendation for Key Management: Part 1 - General, Cryptographic Mechanisms: Recommendations and Key Lengths, Version 2024-01. - The implementation of cryptographic primitives is flawed. Recommendation: use carefully selected providers of cryptographic code. Examples of such flaws include: o Information leakage through timing (CWE - CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy (4.16), Challenge 17 Set 3 - The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges). An example of this has been observed in a fielded automotive product. o Parameters which are insufficiently “strong” in all possible use-cases.  e=3 in RSA encryption of small messages e=3 in RSA signature validation with incorrect padding validation. This has been observed in a fielded automotive product. o Summary of RSA flaws: Twenty years of attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem. - The cryptographic primitive does not provide the property the use-case requires. Recommendation: carefully review all uses of cryptography to ensure the correct properties are defended. o For example, “encryption” does not provide “integrity” or “authenticity”. Challenge 16 Set 2 - The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges. - The structure/protocol has vulnerabilities (despite using a good cryptographic primitive). Recommendation: use well-reviewed (not ad-hoc) structures and protocols: o “padding oracles”: Practical Padding Oracle Attacks o Reused nonces/IVs: ECDSA-Nonce-Reuse-Exploit-Example o Message extension attacks: Flickr's API Signature Forgery Vulnerability This technique may be used as a precursor to ATM techniques such as: Bypass Code Integrity Protections (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0006/ATM-T0031) & Bypass UDS Security Access (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0006/ATM-T0033)",

            "description": "Adversaries may compromise the cryptographic mechanisms used by vehicles to bypass controls that would otherwise protect assets. These assets may be internal to an ECU, or used in communication between ECUs within the vehicle, or with services outside the vehicle. This technique does not cover exploitation of poorly-protected keys. See  ECU Credential Dumping (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0007/ATM-T0039) & Unsecured Credentials (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0007/ATM-T0040). Cryptographic methods can be used to protect the security properties of assets both within a vehicle or ECU and between a vehicle and other communication partners. They are intended to be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated key. Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key. Adversaries can compromise assets within the vehicle (or its ECUs) by exploiting a variety of issues relating to cryptography. Examples and references are given below - these are in no way an exhaustive list. There are a huge number of cryptographic flaws of various kinds which have existed and continue to occur. - The algorithm is inherently weak (Dismantling Megamos Crypto: Wirelessly Lockpicking a Vehicle Immobilizer, Gone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2). Recommendation: use consensus standard cryptography. - The security strength of the cryptography used is not sufficient. Recent recommendations can be found in Recommendation for Key Management: Part 1 - General, Cryptographic Mechanisms: Recommendations and Key Lengths, Version 2024-01. - The implementation of cryptographic primitives is flawed. Recommendation: use carefully selected providers of cryptographic code. Examples of such flaws include: o Information leakage through timing (CWE - CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy (4.16), Challenge 17 Set 3 - The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges). An example of this has been observed in a fielded automotive product. o Parameters which are insufficiently “strong” in all possible use-cases.  e=3 in RSA encryption of small messages e=3 in RSA signature validation with incorrect padding validation. This has been observed in a fielded automotive product. o Summary of RSA flaws: Twenty years of attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem. - The cryptographic primitive does not provide the property the use-case requires. Recommendation: carefully review all uses of cryptography to ensure the correct properties are defended. o For example, “encryption” does not provide “integrity” or “authenticity”. Challenge 16 Set 2 - The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges. - The structure/protocol has vulnerabilities (despite using a good cryptographic primitive). Recommendation: use well-reviewed (not ad-hoc) structures and protocols: o “padding oracles”: Practical Padding Oracle Attacks o Reused nonces/IVs: ECDSA-Nonce-Reuse-Exploit-Example o Message extension attacks: Flickr's API Signature Forgery Vulnerability This technique may be used as a precursor to ATM techniques such as: Bypass Code Integrity Protections (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0006/ATM-T0031) & Bypass UDS Security Access (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0006/ATM-T0033)",

            "description": "Adversaries may compromise the cryptographic mechanisms used by vehicles to bypass controls that would otherwise protect assets. These assets may be internal to an ECU, or used in communication between ECUs within the vehicle, or with services outside the vehicle. This technique does not cover exploitation of poorly-protected keys. See  ECU Credential Dumping (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0007/ATM-T0039) & Unsecured Credentials (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0007/ATM-T0040). Cryptographic methods can be used to protect the security properties of assets both within a vehicle or ECU and between a vehicle and other communication partners. They are intended to be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated key. Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key. Adversaries can compromise assets within the vehicle (or its ECUs) by exploiting a variety of issues relating to cryptography. Examples and references are given below - these are in no way an exhaustive list. There are a huge number of cryptographic flaws of various kinds which have existed and continue to occur. - The algorithm is inherently weak (Dismantling Megamos Crypto: Wirelessly Lockpicking a Vehicle Immobilizer, Gone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2). Recommendation: use consensus standard cryptography. - The security strength of the cryptography used is not sufficient. Recent recommendations can be found in Recommendation for Key Management: Part 1 - General, Cryptographic Mechanisms: Recommendations and Key Lengths, Version 2024-01. - The implementation of cryptographic primitives is flawed. Recommendation: use carefully selected providers of cryptographic code. Examples of such flaws include: o Information leakage through timing (CWE - CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy (4.16), Challenge 17 Set 3 - The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges). An example of this has been observed in a fielded automotive product. o Parameters which are insufficiently “strong” in all possible use-cases.  e=3 in RSA encryption of small messages e=3 in RSA signature validation with incorrect padding validation. This has been observed in a fielded automotive product. o Summary of RSA flaws: Twenty years of attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem. - The cryptographic primitive does not provide the property the use-case requires. Recommendation: carefully review all uses of cryptography to ensure the correct properties are defended. o For example, “encryption” does not provide “integrity” or “authenticity”. Challenge 16 Set 2 - The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges. - The structure/protocol has vulnerabilities (despite using a good cryptographic primitive). Recommendation: use well-reviewed (not ad-hoc) structures and protocols: o “padding oracles”: Practical Padding Oracle Attacks o Reused nonces/IVs: ECDSA-Nonce-Reuse-Exploit-Example o Message extension attacks: Flickr's API Signature Forgery Vulnerability This technique may be used as a precursor to ATM techniques such as: Bypass Code Integrity Protections (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0006/ATM-T0031) & Bypass UDS Security Access (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0006/ATM-T0033)",

Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for sensitive information. Compared to traditional PCs, the constrained display size of vehicle screens may impair the ability to provide users with contextual information, making users more susceptible to this technique's use. Specific approaches to this technique include: - Impersonate the identity of a legitimate application: A malicious application could impersonate the identity of a legitimate application (e.g. use the same application name and/or icon) and get installed on the vehicle. The malicious app could then prompt the user for sensitive information. - Display a prompt on top of a running legitimate application: A malicious application could display a prompt on top of a running legitimate application to trick users into entering sensitive information into the malicious application rather than the legitimate application. Typically, the malicious application would need to know when the targeted application (and individual activity within the targeted application) is running in the foreground, so that the malicious application knows when to display its prompt. Android 5.0 and 5.1.1, respectively, increased the difficulty of determining the current foreground application through modifications to the ActivityManager API. A malicious application can still abuse Android's accessibility features to determine which application is currently in the foreground. Approaches to display a prompt include: 1) A malicious application could start a new activity on top of a running legitimate application. Android 10 places new restrictions on the ability for an application to start a new activity on top of another application, which may make it more difficult for adversaries to utilize this technique. 2) A malicious application could create an application overlay window on top of a running legitimate application. Applications must hold the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission to create overlay windows. This permission is handled differently than typical Android permissions, and at least under certain conditions is automatically granted to applications installed from the Google Play Store. The SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission and its associated ability to create application overlay windows are expected to be deprecated in a future release of Android in favor of a new API. - Fake device notifications: A malicious application could send fake device notifications to the user. Clicking on the device notification could trigger the malicious application to display an input prompt. This technique's description was adapted from MITRE ATT&CK.",

An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data. Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary. Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.Adversaries may also try to collect vehicle telemetry, including propulsion system status (e.g., hard acceleration or braking), whether vehicle enclosures are locked / unlocked, etc. This technique's description was adapted from MITRE ATT&CK.",

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable control of additional ECUs on the vehicle network. An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through network service scanning or other discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities, or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation.

These assets may be internal to an ECU, or used in communication between ECUs within the vehicle, or with services outside the vehicle. This technique does not cover exploitation of poorly-protected keys. See  ECU Credential Dumping (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0007/ATM-T0039) & Unsecured Credentials (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0007/ATM-T0040). Cryptographic methods can be used to protect the security properties of assets both within a vehicle or ECU and between a vehicle and other communication partners. They are intended to be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated key. Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key. Adversaries can compromise assets within the vehicle (or its ECUs) by exploiting a variety of issues relating to cryptography. Examples and references are given below - these are in no way an exhaustive list. There are a huge number of cryptographic flaws of various kinds which have existed and continue to occur. - The algorithm is inherently weak (Dismantling Megamos Crypto: Wirelessly Lockpicking a Vehicle Immobilizer, Gone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2). Recommendation: use consensus standard cryptography. - The security strength of the cryptography used is not sufficient. Recent recommendations can be found in Recommendation for Key Management: Part 1 - General, Cryptographic Mechanisms: Recommendations and Key Lengths, Version 2024-01. - The implementation of cryptographic primitives is flawed. Recommendation: use carefully selected providers of cryptographic code. Examples of such flaws include: o Information leakage through timing (CWE - CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy (4.16), Challenge 17 Set 3 - The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges). An example of this has been observed in a fielded automotive product. o Parameters which are insufficiently “strong” in all possible use-cases.  e=3 in RSA encryption of small messages e=3 in RSA signature validation with incorrect padding validation. This has been observed in a fielded automotive product. o Summary of RSA flaws: Twenty years of attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem. - The cryptographic primitive does not provide the property the use-case requires. Recommendation: carefully review all uses of cryptography to ensure the correct properties are defended. o For example, “encryption” does not provide “integrity” or “authenticity”. Challenge 16 Set 2 - The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges. - The structure/protocol has vulnerabilities (despite using a good cryptographic primitive). Recommendation: use well-reviewed (not ad-hoc) structures and protocols: o “padding oracles”: Practical Padding Oracle Attacks o Reused nonces/IVs: ECDSA-Nonce-Reuse-Exploit-Example o Message extension attacks: Flickr's API Signature Forgery Vulnerability This technique may be used as a precursor to ATM techniques such as: Bypass Code Integrity Protections (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0006/ATM-T0031) & Bypass UDS Security Access (https://atm.automotiveisac.com/technique/ATM-TA0006/ATM-T0033)",
