# OpenASC-Catalogs

OpenASC is an open-source repository of structured threat and control catalogs. It provides a foundational resource for systematically identifying and mitigating security threats in the automotive domain utilizing classification models like STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CKÂ©. OpenASC is designed to support processes outlined in Clause 15 of ISO/SAE 21434 and the United Nations regulation no.155 for cybersecurity management in road vehicles.

## Features
- **Threat Catalog**: Comprehensive list of automotive-specific threats, classified (e.g., STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK) and mapped to regulations (e.g., UN Regulation No. 155).
- **Control Catalog**: Standardized security controls with detailed descriptions and mappings to regulations (e.g., UN Regulation No. 155).
- **Threat/Control Relationships**: Explicit mappings indicate which controls mitigate specific threats and which threats possibly affect some controls.
- **JSON Schema Validation**: All catalogs are validated against strict JSON Schemas for consistency and interoperability.
- **Validation Scripts**: Node.js scripts for validating catalog files.
